    Data Subject Rights

    Under certain circumstances, data subjects in United States have certain rights relating to their personal data, which include the rights to request from the Controller (a) access to the data subject’s personal data; (b) correction of incomplete or inaccurate personal data; (c) erasure of personal data; (d) restriction of processing concerning the data subject; and (e) that the controller provide a copy of the data subject’s personal data that the data subject provided to the controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Data subjects may also object to a controller’s processing of personal data under certain circumstances. Where processing is based on a data subject’s consent, the data subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time; however, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
